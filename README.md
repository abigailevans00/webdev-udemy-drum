## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- JavaScript


### What I learned

This was a challenge from Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp 2022 that was very enjoyable. In it I learned how to add Event Listeners. The final result was a drum kit operated by a keyboard or mouse that emmitted realistic drum sounds.


### Continued development

I would like to learn more about finding DOM elements using query selectors.
